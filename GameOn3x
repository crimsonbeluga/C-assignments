/ GameOn3x.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//
// The #include directive is a way to include external files or libraries in your program. It ensures that the definitions, declarations, or code from the specified file is made available to your program.
// the <iostream>  defines objects like std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr, and std::clog for handling input and output:
#include <iostream>

//A namespace in C++ is a container for identifiers (like classes, functions, variables) that helps avoid name conflicts in large programs.
//When you write using namespace std;, you are telling the compiler to use all the names (like cout, cin, endl, etc.) from the std namespace without needing to prefix them with std::.

using namespace std;

// The keyword int specifies that the main function returns an integer value.
// The return value from main() is used to indicate the program's exit status to the operating system:
//main is the name of the function where the program starts executing.It is required in every C++ program and is always called automatically when the program runs.
// The operating system invokes main() to begin program execution

int main()
{
    // cout Stands for "character output."
    //It is an object from the <iostream> library that represents the standard output stream(usually the console).

    cout << "Game Over!" << endl;
    // was told that this return vakue did not matter and was not yet needed
    return 0;
